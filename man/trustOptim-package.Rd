\title{
Nonlinear optimizers using trust regions, with methods optimized for sparse Hessians.
}
\description{
Trust region algorithm for nonlinear optimization. In addition to
being more stable and robust than optim, this package includes 
methods that are scalable and efficient (in terms
of both speed and memory usage) when the Hessian is sparse.
