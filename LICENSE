The following applies to the code in files src/DSSM-FDHS.c and inst/misc/DSSM-FDHS.f

The original source code of the DSSM and FDHS algorithms was published by

Coleman, Thomas F., Burton S. Garbow and Jorge J. More. (1985).
Algorithm 636:  FORTRAN Subroutines for Estimating Sparse Hessian Matrices
ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, 11(4), p. 378

The file DSSM-FDHS.f has been modifed to support DOUBLE PRECISION types. 
The file DSSM-FDHS.c was created using the f2c utility.
