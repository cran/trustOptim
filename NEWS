NEWS file for trustOptim package



VERSION 0.8.0 (Dec. 27, 2012)

   o   Removed sparseFD method. Instead, use the sparseHessianFD package for similar funcationality.

   o   All ACM-licensed code was removed from the package and moved to the sparseHessianFD package.

   o   Disabled the diagonal preconditioner, which was segfaulting for some yet-to-be-identified
       reason.  Since it didn't work much better than no preconditioner at all, it's no great loss. 
       The modified Cholesky preconditioner remains.

   o   In the control list, setting preconditioner to 1 implements the modified Cholesky preconditioner.
       The value 2 is no longer a valid (and will default to the identity preconditioner).

   o   Fixed a bug where the function.scale.factor option defaulted to -1 instead of 1.
       It now defaults to 1.


VERSION 0.7.1 (Sept. 27, 2012)

   o   Added get.fdfh function to return estimate of sparse Hessian when only the structure is known.

   o   Added vignette that describes how to use the package, and compares performance to some other optimizers.


VERSION 0.7.0

   o  Initial upload to CRAN.
